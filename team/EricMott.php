			<h3>Eric Mott</h3>
			<p>Eric Mott has been with the lab since the fall of 2008.  He largely contributed to the success of the PDT project during his undergraduate time.  Now with a B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering ('11) along with a Master of Engineering and Management ('12), he serves as a part-time research assistant managing the lab's Bone Tissue Engineering work, namely, the fabrication of bioresorbable poly(propylene-fumarate) PPF scaffolds via additive manufacturing.  His work on this led to a major break through surrounding dye-initiator packages for polymer resins, which led to a large reduction in labor needed to create high resolution parts from PPF.  A patent application has been submitted regarding this finding.</p>
